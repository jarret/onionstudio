The htdocs/ subdirectory is what should be deployed on a webserver. Right now the websocket endpoint is hard-coded to onion.studio's AWS deployment for the websocket.

The deploy script is also hardcoded to the AWS deployment.

For basic localhost development the serve-htdocs.sh script might be useful.
